# A collection for fashion outfit datasets

This is a working-in-progress repository. The API for outfit dataloader is mainly for personal purpose and will change rapidly. I currently use it as a submodule of other repository.

## How to

1. install the `outfit_datasets` package
   
```bash
python setup.py install
```

2. Go to each folder and run the script to process the dataset.

## TODOs

scripts for data processing:

- [x] Polyvore-U
- [ ] Maryland Polyvore
- [ ] Polyvore Outfits
- [ ] iFashion
