# A collection for fashion outfit datasets

The API for outfit dataloader is for personal purpose and will change rapidly. I currently use it as a submodule of other repository.

## How-to

1. install the `outfit_datasets` package

```bash
python setup.py install
```

2. Go to each sub-folder and run scripts to process the dataset.

   - `ifashion`
   - `iqon-3000`
   - `maryland-polyvore`
   - `polyvore-180`
   - `polyvore-outfits`
   - `polyvore-u`
   - `shift15m`
