# A collection for fashion outfit datasets

This is a working-in-progress repository. The API for outfit dataloader is mainly for personal purpose and will change rapidly. I currently use it as a submodule of other repository.

## How to

1. install the `outfit_datasets` package
   
```bash
python setup.py install
```

1. Go to each sub-folder and run scripts to process the dataset.

    - `ifashion`
    - `iqon-3000`
    - `maryland-polyvore`
    - `polyvore-180`
    - `polyvore-outfits`
    - `polyvore-u`
    - `shift15m`
